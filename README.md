# COMP551-MachineLearning
Assignment 1- MSE/L2/Gradient Descent written only using the numpy library for matrices. Linear Regression is applied upon, along with ridge regression, Communities and Crime dataset. 

Assignment 2- Comparison of Linear Classification in comparision with K-NN Classification, written only using numpy.

Assignment 3- Predicting values of Yelp and IMDB Reviews, using different word representations. Compared Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Linear SVM.

Neural Network was written from scratch,using only numpy for matrices and skimage to read the images, in order to be able to identify images of digits from 0-9.
